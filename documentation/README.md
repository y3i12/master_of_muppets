# Master of Muppets - USB MIDI to CV Converter

A professional-grade USB MIDI to 16-channel CV converter built on Teensy 4.1 with AI-assisted development methodology.

## Project Overview

Master of Muppets is a high-performance USB MIDI to CV converter that transforms MIDI pitch bend messages into precise 0-10V control voltages across 16 independent channels. Built on the powerful Teensy 4.1 platform, it delivers sub-millisecond latency suitable for professional audio and modular synthesizer applications.

## Key Features

- **16 Channels**: Independent CV outputs (0-10V range)
- **High Precision**: 12-bit DAC resolution (4096 levels)
- **Low Latency**: 2-3ms total system response time
- **Real-time Performance**: Deterministic threading with TeensyThreads
- **Template Architecture**: Flexible DAC driver system
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive analysis and optimization
