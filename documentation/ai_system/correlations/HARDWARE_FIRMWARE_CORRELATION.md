# Hardware-Firmware Correlation

## Overview

The hardware-firmware correlation represents the most critical cross-domain relationship in the Master of Muppets system, where hardware constraints and capabilities directly influence firmware architecture and performance.

## Correlation Examples

### Timing Correlation: AD5593R DAC and Threading

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Hardware-Firmware Timing Correlation"
        subgraph "Hardware Constraint"
            DAC[AD5593R DAC<br/>I2C Transaction: ~20μs<br/>Settling Time: 6μs]
        end
        
        subgraph "Firmware Constraint"
            THREAD[Threading System<br/>Thread Slice: 10μs<br/>Cooperative Yield]
        end
        
        subgraph "Correlation Analysis"
            COMPATIBILITY[I2C fits in 2 thread slices<br/>Total: 26μs budget<br/>Actual: 20μs usage]
            OPTIMIZATION[DMA opportunity<br/>Zero-CPU overhead<br/>Future enhancement]
        end
        
        DAC --> COMPATIBILITY
        THREAD --> COMPATIBILITY
        COMPATIBILITY --> OPTIMIZATION
    end
```
