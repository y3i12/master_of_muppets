# Cognitive Enhancement Toolkit Requirements
# Most functionality works with just Python standard library

# Optional enhancements (install if needed):
# psutil>=5.8.0        # For memory tracking (optional)
# pathlib>=1.0.1       # Usually included in Python 3.4+
# json>=2.0.9          # Usually included in Python standard library

# No external dependencies required for core functionality!
# The toolkit is designed to work with pure Python.
