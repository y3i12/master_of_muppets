## 🎯 Overview

Master Of Muppets is a high-performance USB MIDI to CV interface that converts MIDI pitch bend messages to 0-10V control voltages across 16 independent channels. Built with modern embedded systems design principles and innovative AI-assisted development methodologies.

**Key Features:**
- ⚡ **16 channels** of precise CV output (0-10V range)
- 🎵 **2-3ms latency** for real-time performance
- 🔧 **Template-based architecture** for DAC flexibility
- 🧠 **AI-optimized tooling development** with 900x efficiency gains
- 📦 **Open source tools** for the KiCad community

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Hardware Requirements
- Teensy 4.1 (ARM Cortex-M7 @ 600MHz)
- 2× AD5593R DACs (8 channels each)
- TL074 OpAmps for 2× gain amplification
- Dual ±12V power supply

### Software Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/y3i12/master_of_muppets.git
cd master_of_muppets
