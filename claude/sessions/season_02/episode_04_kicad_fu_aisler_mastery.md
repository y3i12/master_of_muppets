## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implementation

### **Manufacturing Intelligence Modules**

**1. AISLER Optimizer (`aisler_optimizer.py`)**
```python
class AislerOptimizer:
    """Cognitive optimizer for AISLER PCB manufacturing"""
    
    # Design rule database with current AISLER specs
    design_rules = {
        '2L_HASL_1.6': AislerDesignRules(...),
        '2L_ENIG_1.6': AislerDesignRules(...), 
        '4L_ENIG_1.6': AislerDesignRules(...),
        '4L_ENIG_0.8': AislerDesignRules(...)
    }
    
    # Cognitive analysis with learning integration
    def analyze_project_requirements(self, project_data)
    def _recommend_optimal_config(self, compatible_configs, requirements)
    def _generate_cognitive_insights(self, requirements, optimal_config)
```

**Key Capabilities**:
- Intelligent requirements extraction from Master of Muppets project

- Cognitive recommendation reasoning with learning integration

**2. Fabrication Validator (`fabrication_validator.py`)**
```python
class FabricationValidator:
    """Cognitive DFM validator for multiple manufacturers"""
    
    # Multi-manufacturer rule database
    manufacturer_rules = {
        'aisler': _get_aisler_rules(),
        'jlcpcb': _get_jlcpcb_rules(), 
        'generic': _get_generic_rules()
    }
    
    # Intelligent validation with cognitive suggestions
    def validate_design(self, project_data, manufacturer='aisler')
    def compare_manufacturers(self, project_data)
    def _generate_cognitive_suggestion(self, rule, actual, required)
```

```python
# AISLER optimization tool
async def optimize_for_aisler(project_name: str)

# DFM validation tool  
async def validate_dfm(project_name: str, manufacturer: str = 'aisler')

# Multi-manufacturer comparison tool
async def compare_manufacturers(project_name: str)
```

**New MCP Prompts**:
```python
# AISLER manufacturing optimization prompt
def aisler_prompt():
    return {
        'name': 'aisler_manufacturing_optimization',
        'description': 'Optimize KiCad project for AISLER PCB manufacturing',
        'template': '''AISLER-specific optimization guidance with cognitive insights'''
    }
```
