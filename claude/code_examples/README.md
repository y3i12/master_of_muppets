# Code Examples Directory

This directory contains example implementations and fixes for issues identified during code analysis.

## File Status Overview

### üõ†Ô∏è Pending Examples

- **`batch_i2c_optimization.cpp`** - üü° **OPTIMIZATION PROPOSAL**
  - **Status:** Performance optimization example
  - **Usage:** Reference for reducing I2C transaction overhead
  - **Description:** Shows batch operations to improve DAC update latency

- **`configuration_manager.cpp`** - üü° **FEATURE PROPOSAL**
  - **Status:** Advanced feature implementation example
  - **Usage:** Reference for system configuration management
  - **Description:** EEPROM-based configuration with validation and runtime updates

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Implemented fixes** are kept as reference documentation showing the solution approach
2. **Pending examples** can be used as starting points for feature implementation
3. All code follows the project's established coding style guidelines
4. Examples are MCU-optimized for Teensy 4.1 platform

## Implementation Notes

- All examples use existing project conventions (snake_case, k_ prefix constants)
- TeensyThreads library used for thread synchronization
- No STL dependencies - uses fixed-size arrays and C-style operations
- Proper error handling and bounds checking implemented throughout

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing I2C batch optimization for performance improvements
2. Evaluate configuration manager for advanced MIDI processing features
3. Update this README when examples are implemented in main codebase
