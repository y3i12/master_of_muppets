- **Professionalism:** More suitable for collaborative development

**Implementation Approach:**
```cpp
// Current mixed style
void setChannelValue();
float what_time_is_it();
void throw_muppet_in_the_mud();

// Proposed snake_case with preserved creativity
void set_channel_value();
float get_current_time();  
void throw_muppet_in_mud();  // Slightly shortened but still creative
```

**Code Examples:** All proposed improvements include snake_case implementations in the `code_examples/` directory.
